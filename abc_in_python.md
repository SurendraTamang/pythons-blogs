In Python, an abstract class is a class that is designed to be inherited by other classes but not instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes, defining common methods and properties that subclasses are expected to implement. Abstract classes typically contain one or more abstract methods, which are methods without an implementation in the abstract class itself. Instead, these methods must be implemented by any concrete subclass.

To create an abstract class in Python, you need to use the `abc` module, which stands for "Abstract Base Classes". This module provides the necessary tools for defining abstract classes and methods.

Here's an example demonstrating the creation of an abstract class:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius

# Uncommenting the line below would raise an error since Shape is abstract
# shape = Shape()

rectangle = Rectangle(5, 4)
print("Area of Rectangle:", rectangle.area())
print("Perimeter of Rectangle:", rectangle.perimeter())

circle = Circle(3)
print("Area of Circle:", circle.area())
print("Perimeter of Circle:", circle.perimeter())
```

In this example:

- `Shape` is an abstract class with two abstract methods: `area()` and `perimeter()`.
- `Rectangle` and `Circle` are concrete subclasses of `Shape` that provide implementations for the abstract methods `area()` and `perimeter()`.
- Attempting to instantiate `Shape` directly will raise an error because it is an abstract class.
- You can create instances of `Rectangle` and `Circle`, and call their respective methods to calculate the area and perimeter.

## Why it can't be instanitated?
Abstract classes are designed to serve as templates or blueprints for other classes. They define common methods and properties that subclasses are expected to implement. 
The idea behind abstract classes is to enforce a contract: any concrete subclass must provide implementations for all abstract methods defined in the abstract class.

Because abstract classes may contain methods that lack a meaningful implementation (abstract methods), attempting to create an instance of the abstract class itself would be meaningless. Without concrete implementations for the abstract methods, the behavior of such an instance would be undefined.

By preventing instantiation of abstract classes, Python ensures that you can only create instances of concrete subclasses, which must provide implementations for all abstract methods. This helps maintain the integrity of the design and ensures that the contract defined by the abstract class is upheld by its subclasses.


Yes, that's correct. In Python, abstract classes are not intended to be instantiated directly. Instead, they serve as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from. This means you cannot create an instance of an abstract class. If you try to instantiate an abstract class directly, Python will raise an error.

In the example provided, attempting to instantiate `Shape` directly would raise an error. For example:

```python
shape = Shape()  # This would raise an error
```

Instead, you should create instances of concrete subclasses like `Rectangle` and `Circle`, as shown in the example. These subclasses provide implementations for the abstract methods defined in the abstract class `Shape`.
